# Instalation::wrench:
In client and api

```shell
npm install
```

Then

```shell
npm start
```

In api create a file called .env with this form:

DB_USER=postgressUser
DB_PASSWORD=postgressPassword
DB_HOST=localhost

Replace postgressUser and postgressPassword for your own credentials to connect to postgress. This file will be ignored in the upload to github, since it contains sensible information(credentials)

Aditional to that you will need to create from psql a database called food using command create database food;
